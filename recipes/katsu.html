    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>  
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>  All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>    
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>  
        <li><strong>Panko:</strong> Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>  
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ul>
